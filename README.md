Ride Fare Estimation Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting ride fares using real-world ride data by applying machine learning techniques in Python. The goal is to estimate the cost of a ride based on trip details, user behavior, and contextual features like time and location.

Key Features
--> Data preprocessing with scaling and one-hot encoding
--> Feature engineering with domain-relevant metrics such as:
  --> Cost_per_Min_per_Rider
  --> Duration_per_Rider
  --> Riders_per_Minute
--> Modeling with Polynomial Features + Lasso Regression for non-linear relationships and regularization
--> Evaluation using RMSE and R² Score
--> Cross-validation to ensure performance consistency
--> Model interpretability using Lasso coefficients

Performance
--> RMSE: ~2.0 (on ride prices ranging from ₹300 to ₹700)
--> R² Score: 99%
--> Strong generalization with minimal overfitting

Tools Used
--> Python
--> Pandas, NumPy
--> scikit-learn (Lasso, PolynomialFeatures, train_test_split, etc.)

Getting Started
--> Clone the repository
--> Install dependencies:
--> pip install -r requirements.txt
--> Run the notebook or script to train and evaluate the model
